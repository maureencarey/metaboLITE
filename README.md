# Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

## What is this?<a name="what"></a>

The *ToyCon visualization app* is an R shiny app that aids the basic understanding of concepts conveyed in the following publication: *iNRG: A toy network capturing central energy metabolism for use with constraint-based methods.*

## Functionalities<a name="Functionalities"></a>

- **Network layout visualization**, which is intended to graphically present the interconnections between metabolites and reactions in the [genome-scale metabolic reconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_network_modelling#Genome-Scale_Metabolic_Reconstruction). Nodes of the graph represent metabolites and reactions whereas egdes - connections between them. 
- **Network stoichiometry visualization**, which is intended to depict the stoichiometric coefficients in view of the aforesaid network representation of the genome-scale metabolic reconstruction. The width of the edges correspond to the stoichiometic coefficients that determine ratios of each metabolite in the reactions.
- **Reaction knockouts (KOs) impact visualization**, which is intended to present the influence of the specific reaction KOs on genome-scale metabolic reconstruction architecture and fluxes in the model. By means of the [Flux Balance Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3108565/pdf/nihms299330.pdf) (FBA) this functionality can be used to detect either essential (when removed render the model carry 0 flux through the [objective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_balance_analysis#Objective_function)) or nonessential (when removed do not influence the effective flux value through the objective function) reactions. Additionaly, knockouts can simulate the complete enzyme inhibition that catalyzes the reaction being knocked out.
- **Media changes impact visualization**, which is intended to deptict the incluence of growth media changes on the model growth and fluxes through reactions. The media changes are performed by constraining the exchange reactions in the model during the FBA simulation. For example in order to check the influence of oxygen shortage on the model growth one needs to lower the upper (and lower) flux [bound(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_balance_analysis#Mathematical_description) of the oxygen exchange reaction.

# Installation<a name="Installation"></a>

The application is written in R programming language and uses [COBRApy](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/) for under the hood [Flux Balance Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3108565/pdf/nihms299330.pdf) (FBA) simulations, reaction knockouts and constraining fluxes through exchange reactions.
Consequently an installation of [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) with functioning [cobra](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cobra/) package is required.

## UNIX<a name="UNIX"></a>

### Python<a name="Python"></a>

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) programming language (version of your choice, tested on 2.7.12) with following packages:

- cobra: [constraint-based reconstruction and analysis in python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cobra/0.10.0a1)

To install the packages using [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) package management system type in the terminal:

```sudo pip install <package name>```

e.g.:

```sudo pip install sys```

### R<a name="R"></a>

Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language (version of your choice, tested on 3.4.3) with following packages:

- rPython: [Package Allowing R to Call Python](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPython)
    
   Prior to the rPython package installation please read these [instructions](https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/rPython/INSTALL) to choose the appropriate Python version (with cobra package installed) in systems where several Python versions coexist.

   **Optionally:** Please note that in order to use the Python [virtual environemnt](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/) **within Linux OS** you need to install the rPython package from command line after activation of the virtual environment. As follows:

   Activate the Python virtual environment

   ```source <path to Python virtual environemnt>/bin/activate```

   Install the rPython R package

   ```R CMD INSTALL <path to rPython package source>```

   Subsequently launch the application from command line after activating the Python virtual environment every time. As shown [here](#launch_commandline).

## Docker container<a name="Docker"></a>
The alternative way to run the application is using the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) software to build the image from Dockerfile or run the pre-built Docker image (both provided with this application in `docker/Dockerfile` and `docker/DockerImage.tar`, respectively).  This two  are the most reliable, safest and **easiest installation approaches** due to the intrisic Docker characterisitics. 

To follow either of these approaches install the Docker CE (community edition) software on your machine. The installation instructions can be found on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/install/). 

After installation the docker image can be build with a following [command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/):

```docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | - ``` *Please note that image building may take 10-15 minutes*

e.g

```cd "path/to/the/Dockerfile/directory" ```

```sudo docker build -t toyconApp . ``` *Mind the dot at the end of the line!*

or the image can be loaded from the provided tarball with a following [command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load/):

```docker load [OPTIONS]```

e.g

``` sudo docker image load -i DockerImage.tar```

Next, the container can be run using the built or loaded image with a following [command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/):

```docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...] ```

e.g

```sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 toyconApp ```

The set of two numbers separated by the colon after the `-p` flag specifies the port mapping. The application is programmed to listen on port 8080 (second number of the two) inside of the container. The port is then [exposed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose) outside of the container and it is redirected to the same port in your OS/network with the command above.

Subsequently, to run the application go to your favourite web browser and paste:

``` localhost:8080 ```



# Usage<a name="Usage"></a>

Besides the installation of packages for both R and Python no further app installation is needed. Simply download the contents of this [repository](https://gitlab.com/mstolarczyk/shinyapp.git) and save them in the directory of your choice (represented as `"path/to/the/shinyapp/directory"` below).

To launch the app just run the following line of code in your favourite R IDE, e.g. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/):

```shiny::runApp(appDir = "path/to/the/shinyapp/directory")```

or in the command line:<a name="launch_commandline"></a>

```R -e "shiny::runApp(appDir = "path/to/the/shinyapp/directory", launch.browser=TRUE)"```
