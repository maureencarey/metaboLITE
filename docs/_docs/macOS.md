# Prerequisites

Docker for Mac requires Apple **Mac OS Yosemite 10.10.3 or above** (releases after April 8, 2015). Not sure which version of macOS you are running? This is [how to check it](docs_pics/checkMacVersion.png).

## 1. Download the *Docker* installer to you machine 

Download [*Docker for Mac*](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/). 
The detailed installation instructions by Docker can be found on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#install-and-run-docker-for-mac). See these in case you encounter any problems with the installation steps listed here!

Direct link to the file: https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg

The installation instructions can be found on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/install/):

* [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

## 2. Open the Docker application to ensure it installed correctly

- On MacOS the green dot and "Docker is running" status should be displayed in the menu after clicking the Docker icon

## 3. Downloading and launching the application

Generally, running the commands presented in **3.2** will download and launch the application for every operating system. However, in case of MacOS and Windows, there is an option to use a graphical interface to avoid working in terminal, for details see below.

### 3.1 Kitematic interface installation (Windows and MacOS only)

There is a simple, yet powerful graphical user (GUI) interface available for Windows and MacOS - [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/). Kitematicâ€™s one click install gets Docker running on your computer and lets you control your app containers from a GUI.
Kitematic is provided together with the Docker for Windows and should be ready to use on this stage of installation. 
On MacOS to get Kitematic just expand the Docker menu when it is running, select Kitematic and you will be presented with the instructions on how to install it.

_In case of both operating systems_: once the Kitematic is installed, you can search for any Docker image deposited to the Docker Hub. To download the application, just search the `metabolite` phrase and "create" the container deposited by the user: `mstolarczyk`.

Once the download process is completed, the container will run automatically and you can launch the application by clicking on the web preview section in Kitematic, as shown below:
