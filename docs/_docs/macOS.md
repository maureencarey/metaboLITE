# Prerequisites

Docker for Mac requires Apple **Mac OS Yosemite 10.10.3 or above** (releases after April 8, 2015). Not sure which version of macOS you are running? This is [how to check it](docs_pics/checkMacVersion.png).

## Download the *Docker* installer to you machine 

Download [*Docker for Mac*](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/). 
The detailed installation instructions by Docker can be found on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#install-and-run-docker-for-mac). See these in case you encounter any problems with the installation steps listed here!

Direct link to the file: https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg

The `Docker.dmg` file will be downloaded to the directory you choose.

## Install Docker on your machine

1. Double-click the installer `Docker.dmg` to run it
