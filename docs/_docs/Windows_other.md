# Prerequisites

Don't know which version of Windows you are running? This is [how to check it](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system).

Make sure you have the **virtualization** enabled in your system settings. This is [how to do it](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/#step-1-check-your-version). If the virtualization is not enabled, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIm7f5Epd9U) will show you how to do it.

# Installation - Docker

## Download the *Docker* installer on your machine

Download the [Docker toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/#ready-to-get-started) for Windows 10 **other than** Pro/Enterprise/Education.
The detailed installation instructions by Docker can be found on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/). See these in case you encounter any problems with the installation steps listed here!

## Install Docker on your machine
